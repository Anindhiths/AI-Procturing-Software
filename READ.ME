- **Connection Verification**:
  - MAC address validation against enrollment registry
  - BGP route analysis for geographic consistency verification
  - Split tunneling detection via simultaneous connection fingerprinting

### Posture Detection Subsystem
- **CSI Analysis**:
  - Channel State Information extraction from WiFi chipsets (Intel 9260/AX200 supported)
  - Signal processing: Butterworth filtering with 5Hz cutoff for motion isolation
  - Phase sanitization algorithm for multipath interference reduction
  - DNN-based classifier (5 convolutional layers + 3 dense layers) for posture state classification

## Technical Innovations

### Behavior Fingerprinting
Our system establishes statistically significant behavioral fingerprints during enrollment, capturing 27 distinct metrics across input modalities. Principal Component Analysis reduces dimensionality while preserving 97.3% of variance, enabling efficient real-time comparison.

### Adaptive Risk Assessment
The system implements a Bayesian risk framework that dynamically adjusts sensitivity based on:
- Historical user behavior patterns (weighted temporal importance)
- Examination complexity factors (autoregressive difficulty mapping)
- Environmental context variables (signal/noise analysis)

### Privacy-Preserving Architecture
- Zero data persistence beyond examination sessions
- Federated model training with differential privacy (Îµ=3.6)
- Homomorphic encryption for sensitive metric comparison

## Current Development Status
- Completed mouse/keyboard behavioral models (F1 score: 0.92)
- Screen monitoring subsystem operational (precision: 0.87, recall: 0.91)
- Risk scoring framework validated against synthetic adversarial attacks
- CSI-based posture detection achieves 89.7% classification accuracy

Further optimization of the neural architecture is underway to reduce computational overhead, alongside implementation of transfer learning techniques to accelerate user-specific model adaptation.
